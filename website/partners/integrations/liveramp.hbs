COMPANY

LiveRamp connects customer data across digital marketing applications. By onboarding data into an ecosystem of more than 90 application providers, LiveRamp helps the worldâ€™s leading brands use the latest technology to run more efficient, personalized marketing campaigns.


INTEGRATION

The integration between LiveRamp and Optimizely allows you to bring your offline customer data into Optimizely to enable site personalization. Instead of a generic site experience, you can show customers a specific version of the website depending on whether they're male or female, top customers, etc. You work with LiveRamp to onboard your offline CRM or POS data and tell us which segments to push into Optimizely.
