Google Analytics tells you what’s happening. KISSmetrics tells you who’s doing it.

INTEGRATION

Quickly compare the impact of your Optimizely tests on any metric that you're tracking with KISSmetrics.

When setting up your test in Optimizely, go to Options > Analytics Integration and then toggle the KISSmetrics Integration to ON. We'll automatically create a KISSmetrics property for you and segment people by property value based on the test version that they saw. This means you can segment any of your KISSmetrics reports (Funnels, Cohorts, Metrics, Revenue) to see how different test versions performed. You can also use the KISSmetrics A/B Test Report to quickly see the impact on any event you're already tracking with KISSmetrics.
