COMPANY

KISSmetrics takes all the data you’re collecting and ties it to real people. Every last piece gets connected to a real person. All of it. It doesn’t matter if people bounce around between different browsers and devices. Or even if it takes them 6 months to come back. You’ll see what real people do. You get all the reports that you’ve come to expect from analytics: funnels, cohorts, revenue, metrics, it’s all there. Additionally, KISSMetrics's A/B Test report will open up many new ways to explore and gain insights from your data.

INTEGRATION

This integration lets you quickly compare the impact of your Optimizely experiments on any metric that you're tracking within KISSmetrics. You can also segment any of your KISSmetrics reports (Funnels, Cohorts, Metrics, Revenue) to see how different variations performed within them.
