COMPANY

Ifbyphone is the world leader in voice based marketing automation.  Our applications include keyword-level call tracking (SourceTrak), call routing (hosted IVR), call management (virtual call center), and outbound notifications.

INTEGRATION

Our Optimizely integration works with our SourceTrak (keyword-level call tracking) application to allow mutual customers to test and see what variations drive phone calls along side of which ones drive clicks/form submissions.  For example, if a marketer is testing a landing page they can see which version of a landing page is generating phone calls rather than form submissions.
