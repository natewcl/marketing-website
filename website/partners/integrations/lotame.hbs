INTEGRATION


Lotame DMP and Optimizely clients have a unique combination of DMP and website optimization tools that they can use to easily satisfy consumer demand for rich, relevant and personalized content.

Lotame’s rich audience data segments are imported into Optimizely to deliver actionable insights into visitor behavior.  This data allows customers to define Optimizely Audiences, which in turn, allow customers to analyze their results and target their experiments by otherwise unavailable attributes.
