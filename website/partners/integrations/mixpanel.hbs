COMPANY

Mixpanel is an analytics platform for mobile & web. Along with measuring pageviews, the company helps businesses analyze the actions people take in their applications including everything from uploading a picture, playing a video, sharing a post, and more.


INTEGRATION

This integration dynamically injects Mixpanel tags into your Optimizely experiment variations. This will enable you to segment your Mixpanel reports by the variations your different sets of users were exposed to.
