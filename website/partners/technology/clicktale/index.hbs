##### Integration

Integrating ClickTale with Optimizely will help you to answer the following questions:

• What should I test? Instead of guessing what elements on the page influence customer behavior, first watch Visitor Playback and analyze Heatmaps to identify what changes will have the greatest impact.
• Why did one version convert better? Run post-test analyses with ClickTale to uncover how the changes you made impacted your visitors’ behavior.
• Based on the results, what should I test next? Get inspired with fresh ideas for future tests based upon your visitors’ behavior.

Make use of these key features:

• True-to-life™ Recordings – ClickTale’s Session Playback replicates the exact version of HTML as seen by each visitor to your site. This gives you an accurate view of each of your visitors’ online experience.
• Visual Heatmaps – Analyze different versions of the page and uncover how visitor behavior is influenced revealing the reasons why one version performed better than another.
