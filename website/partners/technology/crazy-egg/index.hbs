Crazy Egg's scrollmap tool shows you how far down visitors are scrolling and determine at what point visitors abandon the page. You'll pinpoint what areas your audience loves and what needs improvement. You can also see where different traffic sources click on your site.This makes identifying your most profitable traffic source - and optimizing your site - extremely simple. You get all that data you need in a clear, easy-to-understand visual way so you'll know exactly what needs improvement.
