			<p>Optimizely was founded by two former Google product managers, Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen. Dan served as the Director of Analytics during the Obama 2008 presidential campaign. While there, his team relied on the use of A/B and <a href="{{linkPath}}/resources/multivariate-test-vs-ab-test">multivariate testing</a> to maximize e-mail sign-ups, volunteers, and donations to raise more than $100 million in additional revenue for the campaign.</p>
			<p>But optimization was hard â€” you needed technical skills and know-how to run even the simplest of tests. After the campaign, Siroker teamed up with Koomen to create a world-class optimization platform that was easy to use in an effort to provide a platform for businesses to be able to conceive and run experiments that helped them make better data-driven decisions.</p>
			<p>Since completing YCombinator in the winter of 2010, Optimizely has seen strong and growing demand.</p>
