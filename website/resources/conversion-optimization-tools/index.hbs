 A solid approach to conversion optimization doesn't stop at the conversion goal. With the right strategy and the right tools, conversion optimization becomes a science and a culture. Starting with a clearly defined hypothesis, each stage of the strategy provides valuable, actionable data to produce the best results possible for your website.

 In this article, we'll look at the five tools that, when combined, can lay the foundation for a complete conversion optimization strategy, and ensure that you’re always maximizing your ROI.

 #### 1. A/B Testing Platform

 ![A/b testing tool](https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/ab-icon.png) A/B testing is the bread and butter of conversion rate optimization (CRO). In a nutshell, an A/B test allows you to pit multiple versions of a web page against one another and funnel your site traffic into each version to determine which design results in a more successful user experience. Do more people click the “Add to cart button” in version A or version B, for example.

 Although the idea of an A/B test is simple, the right A/B testing service makes it easy and fun to run many tests quickly and immediately start watching results pour in about how visitors react to different variations.

 A/B testing platforms thrive and ignite your CRO strategies when integrated with other services. Integrating with an analytics service can give you many more specific details on how each variation performed. Many testing platforms offer integrations that allow for advanced custom goals and tracking. To really take advantage of the explosive amount of data coming in through your A/B test results, try pairing your A/B testing platform with the next tool on the list, an analytics service.

 #### 2. Analytics Services

 ![Analytics services](https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/analytics-icon.png) Analytics services are some of the most well-developed tools of web marketing, and as such, most analytics tools have become extremely comprehensive. Even a free tool can usually provide comprehensive data on where your traffic comes from, the path visitors take through the site, how long they stay on each page, and much more. The sheer amount of data can be overwhelming so don’t worry about tracking everything at once — build slowly!

 Once integrated with your A/B testing platform, you can see how the traffic segments that saw each page variation behaved. Information such as bounce rates, site paths and time on page for each page variation are all measurable with analytics. With an integration this powerful, you’ll quickly find your analytics service indispensable and look to integrate more services.

 #### 3. Marketing Automation Platform

 The Marketing Automation Platform is the engine that fuels the process of turning a simple lead into a new client. An automated marketing machine involves automating and measuring all of the communication between you and your prospect customer. A new lead can be classified and added to an email program automatically, sent to the correct member of the sales team, and much more.

 Linking your A/B tested pages with different marketing campaigns, you can gauge the quantity and quality of leads coming from them. When testing a lead generation page, ask yourself these questions: how does the number of form fields impact lead quantity/quality? Will higher qualified leads fill out forms with more fields?

 Keeping track of both of these metrics, lead quality and lead quantity, is important for scaling your business long term. If a certain page variation increases quantity but seriously decreases quality, maybe it’s not a smart change for the long term. Integrating a Marketing Automation Platform to your A/B tests and analytics tools results in faster, more nimble organization, with greater efficiency and insight for everyone involved.

 #### 4. Heat Mapping Service

 ![Heatmapping service](https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/heatmap-icon.png) Heat mapping tools provide possibly the most direct insight into how visitors interact with your website. By monitoring mouse clicks and other manipulations of the page (such as scrolling), a heat map provides you with a clear picture of where users spend the most time on your page and where they don't.</p>

 Heat maps can help you decide which elements on your page to optimize. Before you even think about optimization, try examining the heat map of that web page. Get a sense of how visitors are engaging, clicking, and navigating the page. Is one call to action button a hotbed of activity while the others are completely ignored? Explore data about your visitors’ behavior before testing everything.</p>

 #### 5. Social Customer Relationship Manager (CRM)

 ![Social customer relationship manager](https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/crm-icon.png) Social CRM is the last tool in our toolkit, and also the "newest," in the sense that mature tools for executing a Social CRM strategy have only recently begun to emerge. However, the potential for customer engagement presented by these tools has quickly made them pivotal for conversion optimization.</p>

 Social CRM is an expansion of traditional Customer Relationship Management that seeks to respond to and capitalize on the vast amounts of personal data and engagement opportunities made available by the social web. Using a Social CRM positions you to turn communities and conversations into customers.

 The easier it is for a client to connect with a company and vice versa, the faster and more effectively conversion optimization will move the needle. Furthermore, the unprecedented level of data collected by an organization practicing Social CRM provides the fuel for further optimization in the future.

 #### Linking It All Together

 Conversion optimization is not a one-time project — when it's done right, it's part of a data-driven culture of improvement, where each part reinforces the rest. By effectively combining these five tools — A/B testing, analytics, heat mapping, marketing automation and social CRM — you will have the insight you need to make your conversion rates soar, the means to turn those conversions into clients, and the data you need to continue to improve.
